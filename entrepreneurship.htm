<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>

<h4>Entrepreneurship is a critical goal in a person's life!</h4>

Beyond survival and self-interest, entrepreneurship creates benefits for others - jobs, finance, goodwill, and sharing of knowledge.  Entrepreneurs are those others follow to become as one in the future.  Entrepreneurs are those who realise the meaning of life is upon sharing ideas, knowledge, things and motivate others to do so.  Entrepreneurs are focused to get to the next achievement than themselves or others, for the benefit of others.  Entrepreneurs are those who are emotionally stable to not need any fun activities for themselves keep them motivated - they are self-motivated due to their realisation of the benefits an act produces to others.  They involve in fun activities only when they want to motivate others.
