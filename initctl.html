<h2>Well, this gets really monotonous over the time !  Creating the same init/ scripts again and again</h2>

What are these initctl scripts anyway?

In short, a service script that runs at linux startup.

These scripts are /etc/init/*.conf files

You invoke a script with:

<code>
initctl start service1
</code>

How do you create one?  Let's say you want to run a node.js app on system startup you would do.
<code>
echo "exec node /home/scriptmaster/service1.js" > /etc/init/service1.conf
</code>

And to list all service scripts, simply issue the command:

<code>
initctl list
</code>

To check the status of ur service, do:

<code>
initctl status service1
</code>

to stop the service, do:
<code>
initctl stop service1
</code>

Services are automatically invoked at system startup !
